  ### Host it yourself on webapp and test in GitLab:
  > Download latest <a href="https://github.com/MentallyStable4sure/Git-Discord-Webhook-Helper/releases">release</a>, unpack, it, launch .exe, or if u r using ubuntu/linux/apache web server/etc. then upload all files on the server, change config/discordconfig.json to your needs (token from discord developer portal and CatchAllAPI_ID of your discord text channel to receive things), then use command on your server:

  ```
  cd /your_folder_with_this_project - to navigate to the folder
  dotnet GitDiscordWebhookHelper.dll - to execute .NET application
  ```
  > Now you can can just knock to:
  ```
  http://localhost:8801/git-catcher/webhook-raw - if you skipped hosting on web server
  http://{your-web-ip}:8801/git-catcher/webhook-raw - paste it to the GitLab Webhook in the settings
  ```
  > Instead of localhost paste your server IP if its hosted on the server, then copy this entire address and paste into Gitlab > Settings > Webhooks (in your project, its the left menu bar at the bottom). Then paste your url into webhook field, mark what events you want to receive and press Add Webhook at the bottom. Thats it, you can test it at the bottom from dropdown menu. Have fun!
